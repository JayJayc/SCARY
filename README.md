# SCARY Dataset (CLeaR2023)

This repository contains a collection of datasets for causal discovery, which are split into two folders: sparse and dense. Each folder contains datasets that exhibit either sparse or dense causal DAGs.

## Sparse datasets (120 datasets)
The sparse folder contains datasets that have a small number of causal relationships between variables. These datasets are further split into two subfolders based on the type of causal mechanism: mixed causal mechanism and linear causal mechanism.

## Dense datasets (120 datasets)
The dense folder contains datasets that have a large number of causal relationships between variables. These datasets are also split into two subfolders based on the type of causal mechanism: mixed causal mechanism and linear causal mechanism.

## Mixed causal mechanism
This subfolder contains datasets that exhibit a mix of causal mechanisms, including both linear and nonlinear relationships. The datasets are split by different types of issues and dataset size.

## Linear causal mechanism
This subfolder contains datasets that exhibit linear causal relationships between variables. The datasets are split by different types of issues and dataset size.
